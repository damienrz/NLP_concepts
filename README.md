This directory is meant to house all the NLP projects I've worked on, big or small. 
I'm still pretty new to machine learning and NLP, and these projects are really nothing more 
than practice and experimentation of various NLP applications and techniques.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or even any NLP coding challenges
