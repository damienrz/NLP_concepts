
This directory contains minor NLP projects I've worked on, as well as past University projects.
The NLP projects aren't anything complex, just some simple ideas I was having fun with. 
I'm still pretty new to machine learning and NLP, and these notebooks are really nothing more 
than practice and experimentation of various NLP applications and techniques.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or even any NLP coding challenges
