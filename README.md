This directory is meant to house all the NLP projects I've worked on, big or small. 
I'm still pretty new to the machine learning side of NLP and these projects are really nothing more 
than practice and experimentation of various NLP applications and techniques.
Please feel free to message me if you have any suggestions or even any NLP coding challenges
